# Homebridge Television Universal Control

This Homebridge plugin enables control of most serial/RS232 and LIRC compatible devices using one Television.

# Use Case

If you use an amplifier, television, external speakers, or other device you want to control using one combined Television in Homebridge.
For example, control volume and switch inputs through your AV receiver while seamlessly switching between TV inputs as well.

# Configuration

It is recommended that you use [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) for GUI configuration. You can also view the [configuration schema](config.schema.json)

# Future Work

I plan to expand this out to be able to control more devices via different protocols, and perhaps present devices using different Homebridge services.
